This project explores multiple supervised machine learning models to perform text classification using a labeled dataset. The primary objective was to evaluate and compare the performance of different models in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.

Key Features:

Data preprocessing including TF-IDF vectorization

Random sampling for unbiased training

Implementation and comparison of:

Naive Bayes

Random Forest

Decision Tree

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Gradient Boosting

k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

Evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Visual performance comparison across models

Tools & Technologies:

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Google Colab

TF-IDF for text vectorization
